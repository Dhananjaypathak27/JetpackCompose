Benfit of using Compose

1. Reduced Lines Of Code

By writing code in one file in the app, it prevents us from going back and forth in XML
files for reviews. If we had used XML files we would have needed a layout for the image
view, image title and written code that links to our Viewholder in the data adapter class
for a list view or recycler view. This implementation would lead to having two or more
 classes and layouts.

However, in Compose we built functions that easily linked these components for us. We
used row and column boxes. Correcting bugs was easier and less
error-prone. Testing times were straightforward as we use one code file.

Application built faster and the apk generated is relatively smaller compared to
XML apps built.
Google confirmed that it saves time and gives better performance than other Android
view systems.

2. Requirements to develop Jetpack Compose

App had to support API level â€“Android 5.0 Lollipop (API 21) and higher.

3. Powerful

Using the Material Design support in app for theming is relatively easy in Compose and
 more enhanced.
 We used the navigation graph to toggle between Compose screens which are merely code
 blocks in the single code base.
 Animations are supported and can be implemented faster with ease.
